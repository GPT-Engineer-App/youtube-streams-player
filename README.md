# youtube-streams-player

A web app featuring two main views. View1 displays a list of YouTube streams, including the streamer's name, stream title, and a miniature image for each. Each stream entry is clickable. Upon clicking a stream, the user is taken to View2, which contains a YouTube player with additional functionality. This includes predefined buttons to pause the live stream for specific durations (1, 2, 3, 4, 5 seconds) and a back button to return to View1.
